## UX

### UX Design

In this project I was aiming to achieve a simple and user friendly user design, while providing all required information. All sections are arranged in a logical order to provide intuitive user experience.

To create warm and cosy design I used the following colors in my project: white (`#ffffff`), off-white (`#f5f5f5`), light-red (`#e64a1e`), black (`#373737`, `#292826`), grey (`#848482`, `#d2d1d1`), and range of gold / dark-gold colors (`#bdaa6c`, `#a99c72`, `#c0b283`, `#e4d29b`).

### Target Audience

This application aims to attract people that like to read, look for next book to read, like to share their thoughts on books they have read, and interact with other readers. The website provides user with information about various books and reviews, and enables them to share their own revious and interact with other users. Users are also able to upvote / downvote reviews. 

The main objective of the website is to provide a user with a tool that will enable them to read / add / comment / vote for reviews.


### User Stories

The following user stories were used to design this project:

**User Story 1:** As a user I would like to explore different holliday destination options so I can decide which one is the most suitable for me.

## Deployment

The site was developed using AWS Cloud 9. To keep records of different versions of all project files git version control system was used. 

In order to track the changes in the local repository the following steps were taken:

- command `git add 'filename'` - to update what will be committed;

- command `git commit` - to commit the changes.

Using `git push` command all changes from the local repository were pushed to the remote one on GitHub.
